## Description

This project is a frontend replica of the popular Fieldgoal) website, developed using cutting-edge technologies to provide a seamless user experience. The primary objective was to recreate the website's frontend while incorporating modern web development practices and tools.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js version 13:** We leveraged the power of Next.js 13, a React framework, to enable server-side rendering, smooth routing, and enhanced performance. This ensures a fast and responsive user interface.

- **Conditional Layout:** To make the website adaptive across different screen sizes and devices, we implemented conditional layout techniques, allowing the content to adjust gracefully.

- **Router:** The implementation of the Next.js router facilitated seamless navigation between pages, providing a fluid user experience.
